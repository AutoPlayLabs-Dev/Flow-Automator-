3. Open [Google Labs Flow](https://labs.google/flow).

### Critical Setup (Important)
To allow the **Auto-Download** feature to work without repetitive "Save As" pop-ups:
1. Open Chrome **Settings**.
2. Search for **Downloads**.
3. Toggle **OFF** the option: "Ask where to save each file before downloading."

## 📖 How to Use:

## Transform your static images into cinematic videos by following these five simple steps.Flow Automator supports text to video and image to video at the same time.


### Step 1: Initialize Your Project
* **Launch:** Open the **Flow Automator** extension from your Chrome toolbar.
* **New Project:** Click on **"Start New Project"** to clear the workspace and begin a fresh automation sequence.

### Step 2: Select "Frame to Video" Mode
Within the dashboard, locate and select the **"Frame to Video"** feature. 
> **Note:** This mode is recommended for maximum control over motion, composition, and maintaining visual consistency from your source image.

### Step 3: Upload Source Material
1. Click the **Upload** icon (represented by a `+` or "Choose File").
2. Select the high-quality image you previously generated (e.g., using Whisk Automator).
3. Wait for the thumbnail to appear to ensure the asset is cached.

### Step 4: Define Motion Guidance
In the **Motion Prompt** field, enter specific instructions for how the scene should move. 
* **Example:** `Camera pan right, slow motion, cinematic rain falling.`
* **Pro Tip:** Keep prompts focused on *movement* rather than describing the objects already in the image.

### Step 5: Generate and Refine
* **Render:** Press **Enter** or click the **Generate** button.
* **Review:** Once the processing is complete, preview your video. 
* **Iterate:** If the motion isn't perfect, adjust your prompt and click regenerate. Flow Automator will handle the re-submission automatically.


## 📝 Best Practices
* **Stay Active:** Keep the Google Flow tab in focus to ensure the automation script runs at maximum efficiency.
* **Credits:** Monitor your AI Credits in the Flow interface; the automator will stop if credits are depleted.
* **Complex Scenes:** When using Scene Builder, ensure your prompts are descriptive but compatible with the model (Veo 2/3.1).
